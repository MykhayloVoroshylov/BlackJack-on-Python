It is a BlackJack game made using Python run in the console (GUI would be added later).

Rules: Ace is 1 or 11 depending on the second card, figures (King, Queen, Jack) are 10, the rest is the written value. When playing there are options Hit and Stay. Hit means adding another card to the player, stay means staying with the cards that you have. The values are not to be over 21. 

The one with the highest value at the end of the round wins. If both have the same value, it's a tie. If either computer or player "busts" (has over 21), the opponent wins. At the end you can replay or finish the game.

Make sure to leave a review so that this game could be improved :)
